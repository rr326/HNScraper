<h1>Hind-cite Scraper</h1>
<p>This houses the scraper and scraper monitor code.</p>
<p>Note - the script code is in /opt/hind-cite-scraper</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: you need to put a proper credentials file in /opt/hind-cite-credentials.json.  You have to do this manually. So if you destroy your vagrant setup, you have to do it again. (There are more elegant ways to do this, but I just want to get this running again.)</p>
