# TODO

GET UPSTART WORKING!!

Status:
* I can get it to run manually
* It doesn't restart upon boot
* I can't get logging ('logger') to work and I can't figure out WTF is going on!
* It WAS giving me some log info (too many respawns) but now I get nothing (after adding post-stop exec sleep 5) 

    
* make separate testing for monitor
